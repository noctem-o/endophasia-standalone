/**
 * `endo harness attach <root> --control --workbench`: the attached process also serves the DEVELOP workbench on a loopback address of
 * its own, behind a command broker (adapters/pi/workbench.ts). This module is only the process wiring: the controlling-terminal
 * check, the terminal approval, the pairing code, and starting and stopping the server. Nothing here sends a command.
 *
 * The terminal is the authority. Approvals are typed on the process's CONTROLLING terminal: stdin and stderr must both be that
 * terminal itself (a pipe, a file, a socket, another terminal, or no terminal is refused before anything starts), so a page, a script
 * or a redirected stream cannot approve a prompt. The same rule as the terminal-governed A/A operator, written here for production
 * code (production `cli/` never imports `research/`).
