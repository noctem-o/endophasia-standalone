/**
 * `endo studio`: Endophasia Studio, a read-only browser interface over a recorded store. A thin command: it validates its arguments,
 * finds the page packaged beside it, and hands both to the shared host (cockpit-http/host.ts), which starts the unchanged cockpit
 * server on the loopback interface. It adds no route, header or policy and reads no store itself.
 *
 *   endo studio [<root>] [--root dir] [--port n] [--key-file path]     serve until interrupted
 *   endo studio --help | -h
 *
 * Order, and what each step may do: (1) the arguments are parsed and refused, if wrong, before anything exists (exit 2); (2) the
 * page's files are found and checked whole; (3) the dedicated cockpit key is loaded, or created on the first launch (the one write
 * Studio can cause; never the installation key, never the store); (4) the server starts; (5) the stop handlers are attached; (6) the
 * access address is printed, once, on stdout. A failure at 2 to 4 is exit 1 with a fixed sentence that never carries the address.
 * SIGINT or SIGTERM closes the server and the command returns, so the process ends by itself with exit 0.
 *
 * Studio's stdout is a human line, an explicit exception to the canonical-JSON documents the other commands print. The host module
 * (and with it HTTP and the cockpit library) is imported only after the arguments are valid, so `endo status` and the rest never load
 * them, and this module is itself imported only when the command is `studio` (cli/index.ts).
