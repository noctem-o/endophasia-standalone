// The host of the cockpit server: what a launcher needs besides the server itself, as callable functions with explicit inputs and no
// effect at import. Two entry points use it, both thin: the development launcher (cockpit-http/launch.ts) and the installed command
// `endo studio` (cli/studio.ts). It adds no route, header, policy or reader of its own: `startEndoCockpitServerV0` is the one place a
// request is answered, and this module only prepares what that function is given.
//
//   (studio-ui.ts)             read the bundled Studio frontend (scripts/build-studio-ui.mjs) from a directory and check it against its
//                              manifest, so a damaged, partial or tampered install fails at start instead of serving a page that
//                              cannot load
//   launchEndoCockpitV0        the frontend, then the dedicated comparison key, then the server, in that order, so a missing or altered
//                              asset or an unusable key is reported before anything listens
//   serveUntilSignalV0         close the server once when asked to stop, and let the process end by itself afterwards
//
// The key is a dedicated, persistent cockpit key (storage/digest-key.ts: created on first use, mode 0600, in a 0700 directory) beside
// the installation key, so a refresh never needs a new one and the installation key is not reused. The one write this module can
// cause is that first creation; the observed store is never written.
