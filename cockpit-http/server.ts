// The cockpit's local HTTP transport: a read-only window onto the observation bridge (cockpit/index.ts), nothing more. It
// reconstructs no evidence, infers no fact, manages no harness and writes nothing: every API response body is a contract the
// bridge returned, serialized in canonical JSON after it was read under the version it declares. A host may also pass the files of a
// browser page, which the server holds in memory and serves at `/<capability>/` and `/<capability>/assets/<name>` through the same
// guards, under a page policy of its own; it reads no file to do so.
//
// Threat model. The operator's browser may visit a hostile page while this server runs, so loopback binding is not treated as
// authentication. A request is answered only if, in this order: its Host is exactly this server's loopback host and port (DNS
// rebinding), its Origin and Sec-Fetch-Site are not foreign (cross-site requests), its method is GET, it has no body, its path is
// `/<per-launch capability>/api/v0/...` (or the page's `/` and `/assets/<name>`) made only of the characters a route can contain
// (no `%`, so no encoded traversal), and its query holds only the bounded integers or candidate-cursor grammar a route accepts (none for the page). Every refusal is a fixed, bounded JSON code that names no path,
// source content, key or capability. No CORS header is ever sent. The capability is a random 256-bit value generated per
// server instance, unrelated to the digest key, compared in constant time and never written into a response or a source record.
//
// Cost. A bridge read reopens and validates the whole store whatever the page size (cockpit/reader.ts), and it is synchronous:
// while one runs, this process serves nothing else (documented in docs/cockpit.md, measured by scripts/bench-cockpit-http.ts).
// So the server serves one read at a time by construction, and bounds how much of its wall time authenticated reads may use: a
// budget of read milliseconds that accrues at a duty cycle from the monotonic clock on demand and is charged what each read
// actually took (a request count would not bound a read that outlasts the refill). It also bounds connections, headers and time,
// never polls, never caches, runs no timer and holds nothing between requests. Unauthenticated and malformed traffic costs no read
// and no budget.
