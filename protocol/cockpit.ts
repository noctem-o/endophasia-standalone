// The cockpit read-model v0 schemas: the versioned, harness-neutral presentation data a future local cockpit consumes.
//
// These are PROJECTIONS, not evidence. They are computed from Endophasia's durable records (the event log and the harness
// registry), never stored back, and never an authority: nothing here grants, infers or exercises a capability, and a
// consumer that reloads them from the store must get the same view. They are therefore not in the durable schema
// catalogue (docs/schema-compatibility.md); they do follow its rule for the records they are read from: an unknown
// version is rejected, never partially interpreted, and a closed record rejects unknown fields.
//
// Top-level records, deliberately separate because their source observations have independent histories:
// - endo.cockpit-runtime-identity.v0: one attachment's recorded runtime identity, last change and last notice.
// - endo.cockpit-capability-state.v0: the recorded capability state of that attachment, with its evidence dependencies.
// - endo.cockpit-session-timeline.v0: a bounded window of the durable event log in storage order.
// - endo.cockpit-snapshot.v0: the three above read together, WITHOUT any claim of a shared snapshot boundary.
// - endo.cockpit-trajectory-comparison.v0: the existing comparison presentation (cockpit-comparison.ts).
//
// Every top-level record names its source (`domain`, how the source was found, and a watermark), and its projection
// definition version (`projectionVersion`): the same validated inputs under the same projection version give the same
// canonical output. Nothing here carries a wall-clock read, a random id, or the store's location.
//
// Epistemic bases are kept apart, never merged into a score:
// - observed: collected by Endophasia itself from the local installation or process;
// - reported: stated by the runtime about itself;
// - derived: computed by Endophasia from other recorded facts (including derivations the record itself declares);
// - inferred: reserved. No v0 projection produces it, because no projection infers missing evidence;
// - unavailable: the record does not carry it (or it is held back by the presentation boundary), with a reason.
// An event's own source class (runtime-fact, interpretation, ...) is carried verbatim next to these; it is not mapped
// into them.
//
// Presentation boundary: the projections copy an allowlist of fields. Anything else in a source record (paths,
// arguments, error text, notice lines, unknown payload fields) is counted or named as withheld, never copied. Where a
// record exists without an approved presentation body, its reference and availability are exposed instead.
//
// Two guarantees, kept apart. WIRE validation (the validators below) proves a serialized record is well formed and
// consistent with itself: references name the right domain, attachment, record kind and id for the view that holds them,
// lie inside the source's watermark, and the pagination metadata agrees with the watermark. STORE verification (that the
// referenced record exists on disk and says what the view says) needs the store and is NOT performed by any validator
// here; a consumer that needs it re-reads the source (cockpit/reader.ts). A validator that accepts a record has not
// looked at the disk.
//
// The protocol imports only the protocol.
