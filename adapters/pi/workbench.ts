// The workbench broker: the ONLY writable boundary of the DEVELOP workbench. It lives in the attached process (`endo harness attach
// --workbench`), beside the Pi child it launched, and controls nothing else: it never attaches to a Pi another tool started.
//
// What it offers, as a closed list of routes under `api/v0/workbench/` (cockpit-http/server.ts guards every one of them: Host, Origin,
// Fetch Metadata, and for a POST an exact same-origin Origin, `application/json` and a bounded body):
//
//   GET  status                 connection, run state, the one command in flight, what is offered and why not. Read capability only.
//   POST pair {code}            exchange the one-time code shown on the attached terminal for an operator grant.
//   GET  transcript?after=n     the live, private, in-memory transcript (with model-provided reasoning, when the runtime supplies it in
//                               structured form, and the message being written). Needs the grant.
//   POST prompt/propose {message}   ask to send ONE new user prompt. Needs the grant. This only REQUESTS: see below.
//   GET  prompt/<id>            the state of that prompt. Needs the grant.
//   POST prompt/discard {proposalId}  withdraw it before it is approved.
//   POST intervention/propose {operation, message?}   ask to STEER, QUEUE or STOP the open run. Needs the grant. Only REQUESTS.
//   GET  intervention/<id>      the state of that request. Needs the grant.
//   POST intervention/discard {proposalId}   withdraw it before it is approved.
//   GET  project                the launch directory's Git context (repository, worktree, branch, linked worktrees, changed files). Needs the grant. READ ONLY.
//   GET  project/diff?snapshot=&file=   one changed file's diff, for an entry of that snapshot. Needs the grant. READ ONLY.
//   GET  workspace              the operator's registered project and its tasks (metadata they wrote), and POST workspace/tasks/<create|update|status|
//                               select|link-session|unlink-session>: see workbench-tasks.ts. Needs the grant. METADATA ONLY: none of them sends a command.
//   POST intervention/check {proposalId}     start a bounded check of whether the capture shows a STEER or QUEUE was consumed; the answer is read
//                                             back from the request's view. Needs the grant.
//
// Authority. The browser can request and can never authorise. A prompt is sent only after the operator types its exact digest on the
// attached process's CONTROLLING TERMINAL (the `approver` below); a page script cannot do that. The grant (obtained by typing the
// terminal's pairing code into the page) only lets the page ask and read. It is single, held in the page's memory, expires, and is
// replaced by a new pairing. The approval is a local operator's decision, not proof of identity.
//
// A prompt is not an intervention: it opens a run, STEER/QUEUE/STOP change one. It has its own record chain (protocol/workbench.ts):
// proposed → authorized → dispatched → accepted, or refused with a closed reason. HTTP acceptance of a request means only that it was
// REQUESTED. The prompt text is never recorded; it is held in memory until the prompt is dispatched or refused, then dropped.
//
// STEER, QUEUE and STOP are not new machinery: they go through the existing intervention desk and its chain (adapters/pi/
// workbench-interventions.ts), behind the same terminal approval. Not here: a shell, a PTY, a raw Pi RPC passthrough, or any store read
// or write other than those two record chains.
