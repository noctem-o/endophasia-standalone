**Develop** is a live, opt-in workbench for [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi): work with an attached
agent, inspect model-provided reasoning and Git worktree changes, and request PROMPT, STEER, QUEUE or STOP through
explicit approval in the controlling terminal. **Observe** examines recorded evidence; **Compare** contrasts eligible
recordings. The read-only `endo studio` server and the paired live workbench have separate authority boundaries.

Beyond the interactive workspace, Endophasia records Pi harness activity, supports replay and controlled experiments,
and imports saved [DeepSeek Harness (DSH)](docs/dsh-native-importer.md) sessions for inspection and comparison.
Pi still owns its execution loop; DSH import does not launch or control DSH. The presentation contracts are
harness-neutral, but Pi is the only live workbench integration today.

*Endophasia* is an old term for inner speech. This project studies observable behaviour, evidence and experimental
conditions. It can relay reasoning **as a model emitted it**, but that text is not a verified record of the model's
internal computation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Source and release status — 31 October 2026.** Build from `main` for the current React interface, DSH import and
> live workbench. Published `0.1.0-alpha.2` contains the earlier read-only browser page; npm's `alpha` tag points to it,
> while `latest` still points to the CLI-only `0.1.0-alpha.1`. The source manifest also says `0.1.0-alpha.2`, so the
> version string alone does not distinguish a new source build from the published package. See the
> [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [published release record](docs/release-0.1.0-alpha.2.md).

<p align="center"><sub>DEVELOP / Field in Focus mode (2560 × 1440). Real browser render of a <strong>synthetic Pi conversation fixture</strong>, not a live model run. This interface is on source-tree `main`, not in the published npm alpha.</sub></p>

### Why use it?

- **Work with an agent:** attach a Pi session, read the live conversation and model-provided reasoning, review
  staged/unstaged/untracked changes, and request terminal-approved PROMPT, STEER, QUEUE or STOP actions.
- **Inspect a session:** establish the recorded harness identity and conditions, read its event timeline, and
  distinguish observed, reported, derived and unavailable information.
- **Compare recordings:** examine lifecycle, tool-call, tool-result and outcome differences across eligible
  Pi and imported DSH sessions, without inventing missing signals.
- **Test repeatability:** replay Pi sessions against recorded model responses, then separately study live
  repeatability and sensitivity to prompts, paths, sampling and execution conditions.
- **Research harness behaviour:** vary the harness, policy or environment under declared conditions and check
  what the evidence actually supports.

## Quick start

Requires **Node.js >= 22.19.0**. Install and configure Pi separately for live work; Endophasia does not install,
update or patch it. The demo and inspection of existing recordings do not need Pi or a model provider.

### Try the current source build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/noctem-o/endophasia.git
cd endophasia
npm ci
npm run build

# Optional demo: use a new or empty directory. No Pi or model call is needed.
node scripts/seed-cockpit-demo.ts ./demo-store
node dist/cli/index.js studio ./demo-store
```

Open the private loopback address printed by the command. The demo uses committed fake-Pi lifecycle fixtures and a
recorded Pi 1.0.0 conformance specimen. Stop the server with **Ctrl-C**.

The commands below run the built CLI from this checkout, so an older globally installed `endo` cannot be selected
by mistake. Rebuild after updating the source.

### Open a live Pi workbench

This source-build feature currently requires **Linux with `/proc` and a controlling terminal**. Both stdin and
stderr must be that terminal; pipes, redirected approval input and unverifiable terminals are refused.

```sh
node dist/cli/index.js doctor --root ./recordings
node dist/cli/index.js harness attach ./recordings \
  --cwd /path/to/project --control --workbench
```

1. Open the private workbench address printed in the terminal and choose **Develop**.
2. Pair the page with the one-time code shown in the attached terminal. Type `pair` in that terminal for a new code.
3. When the session is idle, request a **Prompt** in the browser. During an open run, **Steer**, **Queue** and **Request stop**
   are available when the broker offers them. Each action is only a *request* until its own exact approval phrase
   (such as `APPROVE PROMPT <digest>`) is entered in the controlling terminal.
4. Use **Follow** for bounded polling, or **Read session** for an explicit refresh. See the live conversation,
   model-provided reasoning (folded by default, with a **Folded | Shown** display preference), and the Git
   worktree's changes in **Conversation | Changes**. **Focus** closes the changes/context dock; it does not
   change the underlying session.
5. Optionally keep **tasks** across sessions: register a project once with
   `endo project add --root ./recordings --name "Parser work" --path /path/to/project`, then add
   `--project endo.project.<id>` to the attach command. The **Task** view and the bar's task picker (`T`) hold what you
   intend to get done, with a status only you move; choosing a task sends nothing. See [projects and tasks](docs/develop-tasks.md).
6. Stop the attached process with **Ctrl-C** when finished.

Pi uses its configured model and provider. Select them with `--provider <provider> --model <model>`, or select a
Pi executable with `--pi /path/to/pi`. `--cwd` is Pi's project directory; `./recordings` is the separate
evidence store. Approved commands can perform real agent work and incur provider costs. Terminal approval
controls dispatch; it **does not sandbox the tools Pi runs**. The browser can only control the Pi child owned
by its attach process. DSH imports and recorded-only sessions remain read-only.

See [live workbench and approval boundaries](docs/develop-workbench.md),
[reasoning and privacy](docs/develop-reasoning.md), [Field usage](docs/develop-field.md) and
[Git change review](docs/develop-project-review.md) and [projects and tasks](docs/develop-tasks.md).

### Record and inspect from the CLI

```sh
node dist/cli/index.js harness check ./recordings       # local protocol checks; no model call
node dist/cli/index.js harness attach ./recordings \
  --cwd /path/to/project --prompt "Summarise this project"
node dist/cli/index.js harness status ./recordings
node dist/cli/index.js harness overview ./recordings
node dist/cli/index.js trajectory show ./recordings <session-id>
node dist/cli/index.js studio ./recordings
```

Use the session ID printed by `attach`. The prompt uses Pi's model provider; `attach` reports both acceptance and
whether the run was observed to settle within its wait budget. Omitting the store selects `$ENDO_STORE_ROOT`, then
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/endophasia/store`, then `~/.local/share/endophasia/store`.

### Import a saved DSH session

```sh
node dist/cli/index.js dsh import --root ./recordings /path/to/session-directory
node dist/cli/index.js dsh loss-accounting
node dist/cli/index.js studio ./recordings
```

Name one persisted **Session format-4 directory**, not a DSH home, process or transcript file. Import leaves the source
unchanged and writes validated evidence to the Endophasia store. It does not watch, resume or operate DSH.
`loss-accounting` prints the static mapping contract, not a measurement of that particular session. Use **Compare**
to select eligible recordings; a DSH recording needs a clean, complete import checkpoint. See the
[import contract](docs/dsh-native-importer.md).

### Install the earlier alpha

For the earlier packaged browser page and CLI:

```sh
npm install -g endophasia@0.1.0-alpha.2
endo doctor
endo studio
```

Explicitly select the version: a bare install follows npm's older `latest` tag. This package does not contain the
React workspaces, DSH import or live workbench described above. Full installation, store selection and packaged
verification: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

<a id="studio"></a>
## Endophasia Web

The React/TypeScript browser interface has **Observe**, **Compare** and **Develop** workspaces.
**Instrument** is DEVELOP's default appearance; **Field** is an optional OLED-oriented night-survey appearance
with a typographic terrain, a live-state legend and a **Focus** layout. Both use the same validated data and
authorised controls. Field's motion is not a picture of model cognition.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/field-reasoning-open-1440.png" alt="DEVELOP Field conversation with a model-provided reasoning block expanded and the changed-file context dock visible" width="920">
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>DEVELOP with a model-provided reasoning disclosure. Real browser render using synthetic Pi data; the text is not a genuine model trace.</sub></p>

</p>

<p align="center"><sub>OBSERVE, 22 October 2026. Recorded harness evidence; not a model-internal trace or live workbench.</sub></p>

**Endophasia Web** is the interface's product name. The CLI still launches the read-only browser through
`endo studio`; the separate opt-in `endo harness attach <root> --control --workbench` serves the paired
live workbench. `endo web`, a native desktop app and native installers are not yet implemented.

| Workspace | What it shows | Control boundary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Observe** | Recorded runtime identity, capability evidence, source condition, event timeline and inspector | Read-only snapshots; explicit refresh |
| **Compare** | Eligible Pi/DSH recordings and separate lifecycle, tool-call, tool-result and outcome verdicts | Read-only comparison; no assertion of causal equivalence |
| **Develop — recorded** | Sessions, recorded run structure, tool activity, reported usage and links to Observe/Compare | Read-only; a recorded `running` status is not a live process |
| **Develop — Oh My Pi saved sessions** | With `studio --omp-sessions <dir>`: OMP's saved sessions, as committed-entry counts and kinds, tool and model names, and OMP's own exit records | Read-only metadata from OMP's files; no text, no live view, no control, and no claim that OMP is running |
| **Develop — live Pi** | Conversation, optional model-provided reasoning, PROMPT/STEER/QUEUE/STOP requests, live status, project/worktree context and Git diff review, and your registered project's tasks | Only the paired workbench can request; the controlling terminal approves; worktree inspection is read-only; task metadata can only be read or changed by a paired page and never reaches the agent |

Capabilities and Evolve remain placeholders. Cognition and Research workspaces, general model-internal
observation, an embedded terminal, and live control of other harnesses are not shipped.

**Access and retention.** Both browser launch paths bind to `127.0.0.1` with a private per-launch address.
Anyone with the read-only Studio URL can read the store's presented evidence, so keep that URL private.
`endo studio` does not write the store, although its first launch may create a separate comparison key.
The workbench requires separate pairing and an expiring, in-memory grant to view or request live activity;
the page URL alone cannot authorise an action.

The private live transcript relays user/assistant text, structured model-provided reasoning where Pi supplies
it, and tool names/outcomes, with explicit limits and truncation. It does **not** relay tool arguments/results
or treat literal `<think>` text as authenticated reasoning. Transcript and reasoning content are bounded
in process memory, excluded from canonical evidence and the read-only Studio API, and cleared with the live
session. Pi's own session-file retention is separate. Recorded-only views cannot reconstruct withheld
content from digests. See [reasoning's data and privacy contract](docs/develop-reasoning.md) and
[browser usage](docs/studio.md).

## What works today

This is an experimental project. The table describes **source-tree `main` as of 31 October 2026**, with the evidence
behind each capability. Published alphas have the narrower scope described above.

| Capability | Entry point | Evidence and limits |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Pi identity, local checks, live recording and capability admission | `doctor`, `harness check`, `harness attach`, `harness status` | Installed-package CI uses Pi 1.0.0 with a fake model endpoint; real-model studies used Pi 1.0.1 and later Pi 1.0.4. This is not general-version conformance |
| Durable sessions and Pi trajectory comparison | `harness overview`, `trajectory show`, `trajectory diff` | Real Pi recordings plus synthetic failure cases. The trajectory CLI is Pi-specific; use browser Compare for native DSH recordings |
| Capture and cassette replay | `proxy record`, `proxy replay`, `replay` | Forty exact replays across four recorded Pi sessions and a negative control. Recorded model responses are held fixed |
| Controlled Pi experiments | `experiment run`, `experiment report` | Real studies with blocked randomisation, manipulation checks and declared conditions. The studies pre-registered designs; the CLI does not enforce pre-registration |
| Authorised STEER, QUEUE and STOP | `harness attach --control`, `steer` and the paired DEVELOP workbench; declared experiment interventions | Real-runtime intervention studies and fake-Pi broker/CLI tests. Browser requests require terminal approval; acceptance, observed consumption and effects remain separate |
| DSH cold import and loss accounting | `dsh import`, `dsh loss-accounting` | Five retained captures from pinned `dsh-v0.2.1-rc.2`, including failure/resume cases, plus adversarial tests. No live DSH control |
| React Observe, Compare and recorded-session Develop | `studio` | Projection, HTTP and browser tests; package smoke checks the built interface. Field is optional in source builds; comparison selectors are bound to verified store generations |
| Governed live Pi workbench | `harness attach --control --workbench` | Prompt, steer, queue and STOP requests require terminal approval; bounded private conversation, structured reasoning relay and Git change review. Broker, HTTP, pseudo-terminal and browser tests, plus a real Pi 1.0.1 relay test against a fake model endpoint. No general real-model workbench conformance claim |
| DEVELOP projects and tasks | `project add\|list`, `task list\|add\|status`, `harness attach … --workbench --project <id>` | Operator metadata in `<root>/develop/tasks.json`, separate from evidence; atomic, locked, revisioned, bounded. Store, multi-process, broker, HTTP, pseudo-terminal and browser tests against fake Pi/session fixtures, plus one local Pi 1.4.0 smoke (no prompt, no model); no conformance claim |
| Verified initial scratch copies and governed continuation | Source-tree checkpoint, initial-child and two-turn APIs | Synthetic tests, a four-turn real initial-child pilot and real same-session continuation. Fresh Pi processes and tool-free turns; no historical process restore or general effect sandbox |
| Matched two-turn A/A research workflow | `research/governed-initial-continuation/aa/operate.ts` | One real four-session/eight-request run completed under declared assumptions. Research script, not an `endo` subcommand; engineering hardening remains open |
| Oh My Pi saved-session observer | `studio --omp-sessions <dir>` | Read-only, metadata-only reading of OMP 18.x format-3 files. Adversarial adapter, HTTP and browser tests, plus a read of the installed OMP 18.14.1's existing disposable sessions in place (unchanged; no OMP process run). Not live observation and not control. The first non-Pi session source; Claude Code, Codex, Hermes and Amp are not integrated |
| ACP v1 adapter and ACP v2 conformance study | Library APIs | Deterministic tests; v1 also has an opt-in OMP smoke path. No admitted ACP capability and no real v2-agent conformance |

Cognition graphs, evolution records and selection policies, model orchestration, and mappings for Codex, Prime,
REEF, Magpie, Deadbolt and Cogitator also exist as libraries. They are not live integrations exposed by the CLI or
browser. No working autonomous self-improvement loop is claimed. The full inventory is in
[docs/status.md](docs/status.md); the newest workbench boundary is documented in [docs/develop-workbench.md](docs/develop-workbench.md).

### What the evidence means

| Distinction | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Observation / interpretation** | An observation names its source; a reported value names its reporter; a derivation names its method. Missing evidence stays `UNAVAILABLE`, not zero |
| **Acceptance / completion** | A runtime accepting a request does not prove that it executed, consumed an intervention or achieved the intended result |
| **Evidence / authority** | A successful check or comparison does not grant permission. Consequential operations need their own explicit authorisation |
| **Exact replay** | Did the harness reproduce the recorded session when given recorded model responses? |
| **Live repeatability** | Do new runs agree under the same declared conditions? |
| **Perturbation invariance** | Does behaviour hold when an input expected to be irrelevant changes? |

DSH's persisted turns and steps map to qualified Endophasia lifecycle records. A tool request does not prove execution,
and a recovery-written closer is not an observation of a crash. Comparison preserves those limits: matching layers
do not prove identical causes, and different digest domains cannot establish equality. See the
[vision and distinctions](docs/vision.md) and [comparison contract](docs/cockpit.md#compare-candidate-discovery).

## Architecture

Endophasia keeps execution, evidence acquisition and presentation separate. Its main observation paths are:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    P["Pi session"] -->|"documented RPC"| A["Pi adapter"]
    D["Saved DSH session"] -->|"explicit cold import"| I["DSH importer"]
    A --> S[("Durable evidence store")]
    I --> S
    S --> V["Validated projections and comparisons"]
    V --> C["CLI reports"]
    V --> W["Read-only Studio"]
```

An optional recording proxy captures the model request/response boundary for replay and experiments. Pi capabilities
are admitted from current transport, identity and conformance evidence; a runtime or configuration change invalidates
dependent evidence. DSH has a separate, version-pinned import contract with explicit mapping losses.

The **live workbench** runs inside the process that owns the attached Pi child. Its private, paired broker serves a
bounded, memory-only transcript (including structured reasoning when supplied), offers prompt/intervention requests,
and reads Git worktree information without writing to the repository. Approval comes from the controlling terminal;
the broker re-checks each operation against the current session, grant, state and capability before dispatch.
Prompt/intervention proposals, authorisations, dispatches and outcomes have separate evidence chains, without
persisting the transcript or model-provided reasoning. The read-only `endo studio` server gains no execution authority.

The **initial-state research APIs** are a separate path: verify a replay and its initial scratch archive, prepare
checked sibling copies, start a fresh tool-free Pi session with explicit approval, and require another approval for
its second turn. An independent reader verifies the resulting receipts. This is bounded same-session continuation,
not restoration of a historical process or isolation of all external effects.

Contracts: [Pi attachment](docs/attachment.md) · [capture and replay](docs/replay.md) ·
[DSH importer](docs/dsh-native-importer.md) · [observation bridge](docs/cockpit.md) ·
[workbench](docs/develop-workbench.md) · [initial-state continuation](docs/initial-continuation.md).

## Research direction

The research goal is to explain how the model, harness, tools and environment contribute to agent behaviour, then
test changes under declared conditions. The project keeps execution resumption, exact replay, live repeatability
and perturbation invariance as separate claims.

### Selected results

| Study | Finding | Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Cassette replay](research/README.md#cassette-replays) | Forty replays were exact; a changed workspace produced the expected divergence | Pi 1.0.1, four recorded sessions, fixed model responses |
| [Variance and pinned environment](research/README.md#pinned-environment-study-e3) | With the environment pinned, deterministic sampling and prompt cache off, all judged layers and requests matched across 20 trials per task | Three small tasks, Pi 1.0.1 and qwen3.8-27b on one machine; not a universal determinism result |
| [Path sensitivity](research/README.md#path-sensitivity-study) | Working-directory paths changed whether steering was followed, and changed a baseline on one task | Two tasks and 30 paths; acceptance and consumption were measured separately from following the instruction |
| [Completion cap](research/README.md#completion-cap-study) | Raising the cap from 16,384 to 32,768 tokens raised success from 10/24 to 19/23 | Two selected tasks, four paths, small samples; the interval excludes zero only with all four paths included |
| [Governed initial-child pilot](research/governed-initial-child/1.0.4/RESULTS.md) | Four approved turns returned `ready`; cwd-adjusted request bodies matched, complete responses differed | Pi 1.0.4/Nanbeige4.3-33B, tool-free, private verified receipts |
| [Matched two-turn A/A — 29 October](research/governed-initial-continuation/aa/RESULTS.md) | Four fresh Pi sessions and eight approved requests completed; all request/admission bindings and the independent reader verified; owned-server cleanup was confirmed | `COMPLETE-UNDER-DECLARED-ASSUMPTIONS`. One real run, not a noise floor, model-parity result or server attestation; hardening and an approval-display question remain open |
| [CPU numerical execution probe](research/numerical-execution-probe/FIRST-RESULT.md) | Logits were bitwise equal within each submission schedule and different across schedules; argmax stayed the same | SmolLM2-135M f16, four CPU processes. No specific kernel attribution, CUDA result or integrated model-internal viewer |

The [research index](research/README.md) links designs, results and limitations. Some raw recordings and governed
execution receipts remain private; public summaries do not make those runs reproducible from the repository alone.
See [research data](research/DATA.md).

<a id="roadmap"></a>
### Delivery direction

DEVELOP now includes terminal-approved PROMPT/STEER/QUEUE/STOP requests, private reasoning relay, a read-only Git
review surface and the optional Field appearance. Near-term work is to **use and harden the live Pi workbench**:
real-model dogfooding, interaction/accessibility refinements, failure/reconnection handling, and better diagnosis
of what a runtime reported versus what the broker confirmed. A general docking framework, embedded terminal,
OMP integration and live control of other harnesses are **not** implemented.

**Research and verification** remain a separate thread: extend governed continuation studies, isolate external
effects, and validate cassette-then-live boundaries before claiming general restore/fork execution.

**Cognition** (including proposed WORK and DREAM profiles), an **Evolve** operator interface, model-internal
observation and a dedicated **Research** workspace remain design directions. Native Rust/GPUI presentation,
GPU rendering, durable-execution integrations and hardware/robotics workflows are exploratory tracks, not
current Pi-workbench requirements.

Full plans, candidate studies and deferred integrations belong in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md),
[workbench design](docs/develop-workbench.md) and [vision](docs/vision.md). Measured improvement supports a
candidate; it does not by itself authorise promotion or deployment.

Neighbouring projects have separate roles: [Magpie](https://github.com/noctem-o/magpie) for claims, evidence and derived
standing; [Deadbolt](https://github.com/noctem-o/deadbolt) for authorising consequential actions;
[Cogitator](https://github.com/noctem-o/cogitator) for sealed run records; and
[Buzz](https://github.com/noctem-o/buzz-prime) for a shared workspace for people and agents. A record in one does not
grant authority in another. The earlier Pi-fork implementation is archived at
[endophasia-pi-legacy-deprecated](https://github.com/noctem-o/endophasia-pi-legacy-deprecated).

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:package
```

After dependencies are installed, the deterministic suite needs Node and git, with no model API key or provider call.
Browser tests require Chromium; set `CHROME_BIN` to select it and `ENDO_REQUIRE_BROWSER=1` to make its absence fail
instead of skip. Other host-dependent and private-data checks report their own skips. CI also runs installed-package
acceptance with a separately installed Pi 1.0.0 and a fake model endpoint. See
[test requirements and opt-in real-Pi checks](docs/install.md#running-the-tests).
