// A programmatic consumer of the workspace service that is NOT Pi: no Pi process, no workbench, no HTTP server, no browser, no model, and
// no import of any harness adapter (the test walks this file's imports to prove it). It runs as its own `node` process.
//
// It is not a Codex, DSH, ACP or meta-harness integration and does not pretend to be one. Its host declares synthetic identities, says
// plainly that it has no session it can vouch for, and then does what any later host could: open the registered project, read and create a
// task, move it through the operator's status rules, and read the result back through a second, independent service object. It also asks,
// as a host of a source the file does not know, to link "its" session, and reports that it was refused.
//
//   node develop-workspace-consumer.ts <root> <projectId> <launchDirectory>
// prints one JSON line.
