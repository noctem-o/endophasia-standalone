// The workspace's reads and changes, one at a time. A read happens ONCE on its own, when this page first holds a grant for a live launch,
// and again when the operator asks (Refresh) or when a change was refused because what the page held was old. Nothing polls, nothing reads
// while another workspace is shown, nothing repeats a failed read. A change is only ever the operator's act (a button, a key on a
// button), names a task and the revision it saw, and is never made by the page on its own: choosing a task in particular sends no prompt,
// touches no session or worktree and changes no status. The grant is used from the workbench hook's state and never stored; everything
// here is memory only, and goes with the page or with the launch.
