// The neutral session presentation, built from what DEVELOP already holds. Pure: no DOM, no network, no clock, no randomness, no
// mutation of its input. Each projector reads a record the wire gates already validated (the workbench status; a recorded-session
// row) and returns the protocol's `EndoDevelopSessionV0`. The protocol is imported as types only, so completeness is the compiler's:
// a capability map missing an action does not type-check, and an absent field cannot become a "supported" action.
//
// Nothing here creates authority. Whether the page may ask for a prompt, a steer, a queue or a stop is decided by the broker's own
// `offers` and, at dispatch, by its admission and the operator's terminal approval; these capabilities only describe the same offers
// in the neutral vocabulary, and no control reads them. A live session and a recording of it are separate entries: this module never
// joins them by alias, name, path or time.
