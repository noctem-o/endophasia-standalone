// nothing here is an authority: it describes a Git working tree the broker read, and says WHO changed it never.

// operator keeps what was last confirmed) but marks it not current; a selection is a (path, area) pair, never an id, so a refreshed list
// cannot silently show a different file under the same position; and a read is never repeated by the model: every transition here is
// the result of an explicit action or of ONE automatic read the hook makes when the page is first paired.
