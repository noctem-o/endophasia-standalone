// The project and task workspace as the page keeps it: the last good read, what became of the attempts since, and which task the operator is
// working on. Pure: no DOM, no network, no clock but the one a caller passes, no storage. Nothing here is remembered by the page across a
// reload (the broker keeps the tasks and the last chosen one, in the store root's `develop/` directory), and nothing here is an authority:
// it describes metadata the operator wrote, and choosing a task sends no prompt, changes no session, no worktree and no status.
//
// What the state prevents: a failed or unauthorised read does not discard the last good one (the operator keeps what was last confirmed)
// but marks it not current; an edit names the revision it was made against and is never applied to a newer one; and a task's status moves
// only because the operator asked, in the reply of the request that asked for it.
