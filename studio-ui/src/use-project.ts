// The project context's reads: one list, one diff, only when asked. A read happens when the operator asks (Refresh, choosing a file, the
// next or previous file), and ONCE on its own when this page first holds a grant for a live launch, so the worktree is there when the
// operator looks. Nothing polls, nothing reads while the page is hidden or another workspace is shown, nothing repeats a failed read,
// and a stale answer is shown as stale, never refreshed behind the operator's back. The grant is used from the workbench hook's state
// and never stored; everything here is memory only, and goes with the page or with the launch.
