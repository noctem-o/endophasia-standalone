# DEVELOP: the workspace service (decision record)

Status: implemented (DEVELOP Slice B). Module: [`runtime/contracts/develop-workspace.ts`](../runtime/contracts/develop-workspace.ts). It builds on
[develop-tasks.md](develop-tasks.md) (the projects, tasks and file) and [develop-workbench.md](develop-workbench.md) (the live Pi workbench).

## The goal

There should be one implementation of the operator's project and task operations, with more than one way in: the `endo` CLI, the Pi
workbench's routes, and later a local supervisor or a native desktop host. This is a library boundary. It is not a new server or a
universal transport, and it is not a second store.

## The audit before this change (main at `b940fd161`, PR #115)

| Concern | Where it was | Shared? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| The file format, bounds, text rules and status transitions | `protocol/develop-tasks.ts` | Yes: one implementation |
| The lock, atomic rewrite, re-read and validate, revisions, refusals | `storage/develop-tasks.ts` (`DevelopTasksStoreV0`) | Yes: one implementation |
| Registration (realpath, directory check, read-only Git root observation) | `cli/develop-tasks.ts` | No: CLI only |
| Reading a project's tasks and the current revision for a status change | `cli/develop-tasks.ts` | No: CLI only |
| The launch relation (realpath equality), the writable gate, the read model (`endo.develop-workspace.v0`), when a reference is `current`, building a session reference | `adapters/pi/workbench-tasks.ts` | No: inside the Pi adapter |
| Request shape checks, mapping to HTTP status codes | `adapters/pi/workbench-tasks.ts` | HTTP-specific, correctly placed |

The domain rules that matter most were already shared, so this change does not add a layer. It moves out the two misplaced parts:

- the project and launch semantics, which were inside the Pi adapter;
- registration, which was inside the CLI.

It leaves the store, the file format and the HTTP checks where they were.

### What was compared: DeepSeek's `dsh-superagent` prototype

That prototype's `Engine` is the only writer of its domain records. Each command changes them in one synchronous transaction, behind small
ports. Its "glue" turns HTTP requests, tool arguments and source payloads into Engine calls, and then turns the results back into views.
Side effects are queued durably and run after commit. An immutable mandate fixes a worker's authority when the work starts.

What is taken here:

- **One writer.** Every task change goes through `DevelopTasksStoreV0`. The CLI and the workbench reach it only through the service, and a launch scope can be opened only by `forLaunch`.
- **Synchronous single-transaction commands.** Each change is one locked re-read, validate and rewrite.
- **Thin glue.** The CLI and the HTTP routes translate input and refusals and own no rules.
- **Authority fixed at construction.** A launch scope's project and directory are frozen when it is opened, and its session facts come
  from its host.

What is not taken:

- **No effects queue.** No task operation has an external effect to queue.
- **No sources, triggers, evaluator or assignments.** Nothing here schedules, accepts or executes work.
- **No orchestrator runtime.** Nothing autonomous was added.

### The API

```text
DevelopWorkspaceServiceV0(store, { observeGitRoot? })        operator scope: the operator's own process (the CLI, which supplies the
                                                             existing Git inspector as observeGitRoot)
  read()                                       the whole file, or `unreadable` with its closed reason
  tasks(projectId) · task(projectId, taskId)   one project's tasks; `not-found` for an unregistered project
  registerProject({ name, path })              realpath, must be a directory, the caller's read-only Git observation, then the store
  createTask(projectId, input)                 the store's rules
  setStatus(projectId, taskId, rev, to, note?) the file's transitions; a stale revision is refused
  forLaunch(config, host) → DevelopLaunchWorkspaceV0

DevelopLaunchWorkspaceV0                       launch scope: one project, as one launch sees it (the workbench)
  view()                                       endo.develop-workspace.v0, unchanged
  writeRefusal()                               null, or the `read-only` refusal every change would get now
  createTask · updateTask · setStatus · selectTask · unlinkSession
  linkCurrentSession(taskId, rev)              the reference is built from the HOST's facts; the caller names a task and a revision
```

Every operation returns `{ ok: true, value }`, or `{ ok: false, code, reason? }` with a closed code. The codes are:

- the store's own refusals: `not-found`, `stale-revision`, `invalid-transition`, `bad-request`, `limit`, `duplicate`, `unreadable`, `busy`
  and `storage-failed`;
- `read-only`, whose reason is `unreadable`, `project-mismatch`, `project-missing` or `unknown-project`;
- `no-session`, `unsupported-source`, `unavailable` and `not-a-directory`.

Nothing is written for any refusal. The version is in the names (`V0`) and in the two record schemas, which are unchanged:
`endo.develop-tasks.v0` (the file) and `endo.develop-workspace.v0` (the read model).

### The trusted caller boundary

The facts are split by who knows them, and no operation takes any of them from a request:

- **Operator configuration** (`DevelopLaunchConfigV0`): the project the operator named (`--project`) and the launch directory. These
  come from the operator's own command line.
- **Host facts** (`DevelopLaunchHostV0`):
  - the host's own random launch id;
  - the attachment name;
  - the session source the host speaks for, and the session connected now, read at each call from the host's own state (the Pi
    workbench gives `pi-live` and `piEndoSessionIdV0(…)`, the canonical mapper from PR #115);
  - `session: null` from a host that can vouch for no session.
- **The request:** a task id, a revision and the operator's words. That is all.

Who authorises and who validates each operation:

| Operation | Authorised by | Validated by |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Register a project | The operator running `endo project add` (their own process) | Service: path is an existing directory. Store: name, bounds, duplicate path |
| Read or change tasks from the CLI | The operator's own process | Store: text, ids, transitions, revisions, bounds |
| Read the workspace in the workbench | The broker's pairing grant (`adapters/pi/workbench.ts`, before the route is reached) | Broker: Host, Origin, Fetch-Metadata, content type, body size |
| Change a task in the workbench | The broker's pairing grant | Route: exact keys and types. Service: writable now (file, project, directory). Store: the rest |
| Link the current session | The broker's pairing grant | Service: the host's source is one the file knows, a session is connected, the launch id and session id are well formed. Store: idempotence, bounds |

**A TypeScript interface is not an authentication boundary.** Any code that holds a service object can use it. The protection is in who
is given one:

- The CLI constructs one in the operator's own process.
- `cli/workbench.ts` gives the broker only an *opener* for one launch scope. The broker never holds the operator scope or the store, so a
  workbench request cannot register a project or reach another project's tasks.
- The source and session-id checks in `linkCurrentSession` keep trusted in-process callers consistent with each other. They do not
  authenticate a host. A host that lies about its source is a bug in that host, and nothing in this module can detect it.

The session contract `endo.develop-session-surface.v0` is untouched and has no task or project field.

### Session references

- A reference is current only when it was made in **this** launch, by a host of the **same source**, to the session connected **now**.
  The source check is new and is stricter than before.
- A reference from another launch is historical, even if the same upstream id is served again.
- A session ending changes no task: no status, no revision.
- A host of a source the file does not know (`ENDO_DEVELOP_SESSION_SOURCES_V0` is `["pi-live"]`) gets `unsupported-source`. It writes
  nothing, and none of its sessions makes a recorded reference current. That holds even when it reports the same canonical id as a Pi
  session.
- A reference is not a handle. Nothing reads one to send, steer, stop, resume or select a session.

### Persistence ownership

`DevelopTasksStoreV0` remains the only code that reads or writes `<root>/develop/tasks.json`. It keeps its numbered writer lock, re-read
and validation, atomic rewrite and per-task and per-file revisions, and nothing about them changed. The service holds no cache: every
view and every change reads the file at that moment.

### The two integrations

- **CLI** (`cli/develop-tasks.ts`): translates flags into service calls and refusals into the same sentences as before. Its output is
  byte-identical, and the existing CLI tests pass unchanged. It needs no workbench, pairing code, browser or agent process.
- **Workbench** (`adapters/pi/workbench-tasks.ts`): a translation layer. It checks a request's shape and maps refusals to status codes.
  It asks `writeRefusal()` before reading the body, so a read-only workspace answers every change with the same 409, exactly as before.
  The grant, the request guards, the terminal-approved Prompt, STEER, QUEUE and STOP, and the read-only `endo studio` are unchanged.

### Failure and recovery

| Situation | Behaviour |
| :-- | :-- |
| Damaged, unknown-version, oversize or linked file | `unreadable` with its reason; the file is left byte for byte |
| Unregistered project | `not-found` (operator scope) or `read-only`/`unknown-project` (launch scope) |
| Launch directory not the registered one, or the registered one gone | `read-only` with `project-mismatch` or `project-missing`; the tasks are still shown |
| Stale revision | `stale-revision`; read again and retry. Nothing is merged |
| Lock held | `busy` after the store's wait. A lock of a dead process is superseded (see [develop-tasks.md](develop-tasks.md#persistence-rules)) |
| Crash mid-write | The old file or the new one; leftover temporary files are swept by the next writer |

### Evidence (`tests/develop-workspace-service.test.ts`)

- In-process tests of both scopes: read-only cases, damaged files, references, malformed host facts.
- A real broker and real `endo task` processes writing one file.
- Six concurrent processes (three operator scopes, three launch scopes), each creating and moving six tasks, with no write lost.
- `tests/fixtures/develop-workspace-consumer.ts`, a **non-Pi consumer run as its own `node` process**. It opens a project, creates a task,
  moves it, has bad moves and stale revisions refused, reads the task back through another instance, and is refused when it tries to link
  or borrow a session. A Pi reference recorded earlier stays historical.
- An import walk proving that neither the service nor that consumer reaches any adapter, a
  server, the CLI or the page, and that nothing it reaches opens a socket, spawns a process or fetches.

The consumer is **not** a Codex, DSH, ACP or meta-harness integration. It shows only that the service is usable without Pi.

## Explicitly deferred

- A persistent supervisor or daemon.
- A new independent HTTP or Unix-socket control service.
- A native Tauri or Electron application.
- Autonomous acceptance of work: a task is never completed by a harness's report.
- GitHub event subscriptions and polling.
- Assignment scheduling, retries and queues.
- Multi-agent execution.
- A separate SQLite coordination database.
- Cross-machine synchronisation.
- Session sources other than `pi-live`. With them come three things v0 leaves fixed:
  - a host's own `via` (v0 records only `workbench`);
  - link idempotence keyed on the source as well as the session and launch (the store keys on the session and launch);
  - a test of the same-source clause on `current`, which cannot decide anything while the file knows one source.

  Adding a source needs a new version of the file format (`endo.develop-tasks.v1`) with its own
  validator in the version table. The v0 file must never silently accept another source.

## How a later host consumes this

A future local supervisor or native desktop host would be one more caller:

- It constructs `DevelopWorkspaceServiceV0` over the same store root, with the operator's own authority as the CLI does, or opens a launch
  scope for one project with its own host facts as the workbench does.
- It translates its transport (IPC, a native view) the way `workbench-tasks.ts` translates HTTP.
- It decides who may hold the object. Its own authorisation (an OS user, a pairing) is its responsibility and must be designed with it.
  Nothing here pretends to provide it.
- It copies no domain rule, and it does not need a second store, a second approval path or a universal protocol.

## Next slice

The next slice makes a second, real harness host. That means a launch scope opened by a non-Pi attachment that records its own sessions.
It needs three things:

1. An `endo.develop-tasks.v1` that admits a second, closed session source, with an explicit read path for v0 files. They are read as v0
   and written as v1 only by an operator-visible upgrade, never silently.
2. That harness's canonical session-id mapper, owned by its adapter.
3. Tests that a reference from either source is never current under the other.

A supervisor process comes after that, once there are two hosts for it to supervise.
